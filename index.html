            The Sims 2 is a life-simulation game produced by Electronic Arts and was released in 2004. Players control
            virtual characters, called Sims, and can build their houses, pursue various careers, and accomplish a Sim's
            life goal, their Lifelong Aspiration. The game comes with neighborhoods full of townies, all with their own
            stories to tell. Below are the first three neighborhoods that came with the basegame. Click the links for
            more info about these neighborhoods and the families that live in them!

                The Sims franchise has always offered optional content available for puchase alongside the base games.
                The
                content is split into two categories. Expansion packs contain the most in-game content, often including
                new
                neighborhoods, new game features, as well as new clothes and furniture for sims to enjoy. The other type
                of
                content, Stuff packs, are smaller typically include a set of specific items, but no new neighborhood or
                substantial game features. In it's lifespan, eight expansion packs and ten stuff packs were released for
                the
                Sims 2. These packs are listed below.
