                The Sims 2 is a life-simulation game produced by Electronic Arts and was released in 2004.
                Players control virtual characters, called Sims, and can build their houses, pursue various
                careers, and
                accomplish a Sim's
                life goal, their Lifelong Aspiration. The game comes with neighborhoods full of townies, all
                with their own stories to tell. The Sims 2 originally had three neighborhoods, Pleasantview,
                Strangetown, and Veronaville. Click the links for more info about these neighborhoods and
                the families that live in them! This is not a comprehensive guide, for more information, check
