1. On smaller screens, some elements of your website become misaligned or overlap.
I believe this is specifically referring to my home page and my strangetown page. I have 
converted my homepage to a grid layout to help with alignment issues. Additionally, I 
changed a lot on my Strangetown page. I have switched from article columns to a table in 
order to keep all the information easily accessable. I have added media queries to help 
with misalignment issues as well.

2. Some images lack alternative text, which is crucial for accessibility.
I have been working on updating all of my images and adding alternative text to all of them. 
I still have a few images I need to update but they all have alternative text now.
